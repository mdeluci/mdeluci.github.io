ðŸ’‰ What happens after you pull the needle out?
We built a model to predict how much drug escapes after needle removal during subcutaneous (SQ) injections. 

Iâ€™m excited to share our new work: "A Computational Framework for Predicting Leakage in Subcutaneous Injections".

In this work, we developed a high-fidelity computational model using FEniCS Project that captures the dynamics of fluid leakage during SQ injection. We validated our model with experimental data and used it to study how key factors (like injection depth, volume, needle gauge, site, and wait time) affect leakage outcomes.
Our goal is to support better design of drug delivery devices and protocols that minimize leakage and maximize therapeutic impact.
