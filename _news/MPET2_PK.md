Check out our latest publication: [A MPET2-mPBPK Model for Subcutaneous Injection of Biotherapeutics with Different Molecular Weights: From Local Scale to Whole-Body Scale](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169260724005364?via%3Dihub).

In this work, led by Hao Wang, we established a multiscale computational model that bridges the gap between the local biomechanics of subcutaneous injection and the pharmacokinetic behaviors of biotherapeutics with varying molecular weights.
