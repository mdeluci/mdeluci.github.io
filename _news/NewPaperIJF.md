Check our newest paper [Modeling drug transport and absorption in subcutaneous injection of monoclonal antibodies: Impact of tissue deformation, devices, and physiology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037851732400680X?via%3Dihub) in the International Journal of Pharmaceutics, where we propose a high-fidelity computational model to study drug transport and absorption during and after subcutaneous injection of mAbs. Our numerical model includes large-deformation mechanics, fluid flow, drug transport, and blood and lymphatic uptake. Through this computational framework, we analyze the tissue material responses, plume dynamics, and drug absorption. We analyze different devices, injection techniques, and physiological parameters such as BMI, flow rate, and injection depth. Finally, we compare our numerical results against the experimental data from the literature.
