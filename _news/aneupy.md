Pleased to announce the release of AneuPy v1.0, an open-source Python tool for generating simulation-ready geometries of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The tool is designed to support biomechanical and hemodynamic analyses in both research and clinical contexts.

AAAs are localized dilations of the abdominal aorta that can lead to life-threatening rupture if left untreated. Geometric features such as maximum diameter, asymmetry, and wall thickness are critical inputs for biomechanical models used to assess rupture risk. Despite the growing role of computational modeling, there is a lack of open-source tools that can efficiently generate such geometries tailored for simulation.

Key capabilities of AneuPy:
- Generation of idealized and patient-specific AAA geometries
- Python-based interface integrated with the SALOME platform by Kitware Inc.
- Minimal input requirements with flexible parameterization
- Export-ready models for FEA, CFD, and FSI simulations
- Automation pipelines for reproducibility and research scalability

We invite the community to explore AneuPy and help shape its next steps through the following links:
