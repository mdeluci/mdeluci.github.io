I’m honored to share that I’ve been selected as a finalist for the Robert J. Melosh Medal for the Best Student Paper on Computational Mechanics. 

We had a fantastic time at Duke University, and I’d like to thank the organizers, (Amir)Hossein Salahshoor John Dolbow, for creating this platform to showcase cutting-edge research in computational mechanics. A special thank you to José Andrade and Sanjay Govindjee for their insightful talks that added immense value to the event.

This achievement wouldn’t have been possible without the invaluable support of my mentors Hector Gomez and Pavlos Vlachos.

I would also like to dedicate my participation to the late Professor Manuel Casteleiro, for everything he did for the field of computational mechanics in Spain.
