What role does electric charge ⚡ play in biotherapeutic transport and absorption?

Excited to share our newly published work: “Effect of Electric Charge on Biotherapeutic Transport, Binding and Absorption: A Computational Study.”

We developed a multiphysics computational model using FEniCS Project, combining Nernst–Planck equations with porous media flow, to study how electric charge influences subcutaneous transport, binding, and absorption of monoclonal antibodies.

Our model captures short-term transport and long-term absorption, and explores the impact of buffer pH, BMI, injection depth, and formulation concentration, with comparisons to experimental data from the literature.
