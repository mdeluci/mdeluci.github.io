Yesterday I served as a panelist for the Lilly-Purdue Research Alliance Center (LPRC), the largest industry-university research collaboration in U.S. history.

It was great to share the stage with my colleagues Eden Schipper and Jessica E. Torres and to speak with Purdue undergrad and grad students about the transition from academia to industry, and how research skills translate into impactful work at Lilly.

Thanks to Purdue and the LPRC team for the invitation. Always glad to return to my alma mater 😊
