 I recently had the opportunity to be interviewed by the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, where I shared insights into our work on studying monoclonal antibody (mAb) transport and absorption using their supercomputer, Bridges-2. 

The article, "Bridges-2 Simulations Uncover Better Ways to Inject Monoclonal Antibody Drugs", explains how we use high-fidelity simulations to gain deeper understanding of mAb transport and absorption during subcutaneous injection. This work highlights how high-performance computing is pushing the boundaries of healthcare innovation.

A huge thanks to the PSC team for their support and for the opportunity to share our work! You can read the article [here](https://www.psc.edu/mabs/).
