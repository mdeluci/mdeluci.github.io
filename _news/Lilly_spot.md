Proud to be part of the Purdue University Enterprise Campaign, highlighting the legacy of innovation and collaboration between Purdue University and Eli Lilly and Company

Eli Lilly’s connection to Purdue dates back to 1854, when its founder began his apprenticeship just miles from where Purdue would later open its doors. Over a century later, this partnership continues to thrive, bringing together Purdue researchers and Lilly scientists to advance drug discovery and delivery.

For the past six years, I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with Lilly on drug delivery research, working at the intersection of engineering and medicine. It’s an honor to contribute to this shared mission of developing game-changing therapies that improve lives worldwide.
