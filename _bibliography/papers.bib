  abstract = {Subcutaneous injection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has become one of the fastest-growing fields in the pharmaceutical industry. The transport and mechanical processes behind large volume injections are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a large-deformation poroelastic model to study high-dose, high-speed subcutaneous injection. We account for the anisotropy of subcutaneous tissue using of a fibril-reinforced porohyperelastic model. We also incorporate the multi-layer structure of the skin tissue, generating data-driven geometrical models of the tissue layers using histological data. We analyze the impact of handheld autoinjectors on the injection dynamics for different patient forces. Our simulations show the importance of considering the large deformation approach to model large injection volumes. This work opens opportunities to better understand the mechanics and transport processes that occur in large-volume subcutaneous injections of mAbs.}

  abstract = {Subcutaneous injection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has recently attracted unprecedented interests in the pharmaceutical industry. The drug transport in the tissue and mechanical response of the tissue after injection are not yet well-understood. We are motivated to study subcutaneous injection using poro-elasticity, including linear and nonlinear poro-elastic models. We first present the fixed-stress split of the nonlinear model and perform convergence studies under spatial and temporal refinements. We then investigate the model assumption of the linear model using numerical solutions. In the case of small permeability, the linear model is not adequate to account for the large deformation of the tissue due to injection. Next, we adopt a nonlinear poro-elastic model to study subcutaneous injection. For large deformation, numerical solutions of the nonlinear model differ significantly from that of the linear model, especially near the injection site.},

  abstract = {Subcutaneous injection for self-administration of biotherapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies, has emerged as a fast-growing field in the pharmaceutical industry. Effective drug delivery in the subcutaneous tissue critically depends on the coupled mechanical and transport processes occurring in the tissue during and after the injection. The details of these processes, however, remain poorly understood; and this explains the growing interest in computational approaches. Notably, there are very few computational studies on subcutaneous injection into three-dimensional porous media that account for tissue deformability. Here, we leverage a poroelastic model to analyze the response of subcutaneous tissue under the flow of a pressurized fluid. We propose a computational method based on Isogeometric Analysis that exploits the global continuity of splines. Our model shows the importance of considering tissue deformation and permeability changes in order to obtain more realistic results in terms of fluid pressure and velocity, during and after the injection.}

  abstract = {An experimental and numerical study on the quasi-static loading of AlSi10Mg square boxes produced by selective laser melting (SLM) was carried out. The goal was to evaluate the applicability of common finite element modelling techniques to 3D-printed parts at material and component scales, under large deformations and fracture. Uniaxial tensile specimens were extracted and tested at different orientations, and a hypo-elastic–plastic model with Voce hardening and Cockcroft–Latham’s fracture criterion was calibrated against the experimental results. The boxes were crushed laterally until failure using a spherical actuator. The considered material and finite element models were proved well suited for the prediction of the structural response of the additively manufactured components in the studied scenario.},

  abstract = {The new bridge over Santoña bay has a total lenght of 890 m and crosses from the city of Laredo to Santoña. The main stretch is a cable-stayed deck with a 200 m main span, 90 m side span and a vertical clearance far navigational purposes of 28 m. The simply supported steel deck is being built by segments incrementally launched from both sides. With that purpose, the launching process has been optimized so that its own cable stayed support system compensates the forces generated during construction. The conception of this new bridge aims at establishing a new valuable bond between Laredo and Santoña while at the same time achieving an adequate integration of the structure in the estuary.},
