  abstract = {An experimental and numerical study on the quasi-static loading of AlSi10Mg square boxes produced by selective laser melting (SLM) was carried out. The goal was to evaluate the applicability of common finite element modelling techniques to 3D-printed parts at material and component scales, under large deformations and fracture. Uniaxial tensile specimens were extracted and tested at different orientations, and a hypo-elastic–plastic model with Voce hardening and Cockcroft–Latham’s fracture criterion was calibrated against the experimental results. The boxes were crushed laterally until failure using a spherical actuator. The considered material and finite element models were proved well suited for the prediction of the structural response of the additively manufactured components in the studied scenario.}
