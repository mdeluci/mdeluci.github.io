	abstract = {Subcutaneous tissue mechanics are important for drug delivery. Yet, even though this material is poroelastic, its mechanical characterization has focused on its hyperelastic response. Moreover, advancement in subcutaneous drug delivery requires effective tissue mimics such as hydrogels for which similar gaps of poroelastic data exist. 
	Porcine subcutaneous samples and gelatin hydrogels were tested under confined compression at physiological conditions and strain rates of 0.01\%/s in 5\% strain steps with 2600 s of stress relaxation between loading steps. Force-time data were used in an inverse finite element approach to obtain material parameters. Tissues and gels were modeled as porous neo-Hookean materials with properties specified via shear modulus, effective solid volume fraction, initial hydraulic permeability, permeability exponent, and normalized viscous relaxation moduli. The constitutive model was implemented into an isogeometric analysis (IGA) framework to study subcutaneous injection. Subcutaneous tissue exhibited an initial spike in stress due to compression of the solid and fluid pressure buildup, with rapid relaxation explained by fluid drainage, 
	and longer time-scale relaxation explained by viscous dissipation. The inferred parameters aligned with the ranges reported in the literature. Hydraulic permeability, the most important parameter for drug delivery, was in the range 0.142-0.203 mm4/(N s). With these parameters, IGA simulations showed peak stresses due to a 1-mL injection to reach 48.8 kPa at the site of injection, decaying after drug volume disperses into the tissue. The poro-hyper-viscoelastic neo-Hookean model captures the confined compression response of subcutaneous tissue and gelatin hydrogels. IGA implementation enables predictive simulations of drug delivery.},

	abstract = {Subcutaneous injection of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has attracted much attention in the pharmaceutical industry. During the injection, the drug is delivered into the tissue producing strong fluid flow and tissue deformation. While data indicate that the drug is initially uptaken by the lymphatic system due to the large size of mAbs, many of the critical absorption processes that occur at the injection site remain poorly understood. Here, we propose the MPET2 approach, a multi-network poroelastic and transport model to predict the absorption of mAbs during and after subcutaneous injection. Our model is based on physical principles of tissue biomechanics and fluid dynamics. The subcutaneous tissue is modeled as a mixture of three compartments, i.e., interstitial tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels, with each compartment modeled as a porous medium. The proposed biomechanical model describes tissue deformation, fluid flow in each compartment, the fluid exchanges 
	between compartments, the absorption of mAbs in blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, as well as the transport of mAbs in each compartment. We used our model to perform a high-fidelity simulation of an injection of mAbs in subcutaneous tissue and evaluated the long-term drug absorption. Our model results show good agreement with experimental data in depot clearance tests.},

	abstract = {The MPET2 model couples the multi-network poroelastic theory (MPET) with solute transport equations and provides predictions of the material deformation, fluid dynamics, and solute transport in different compartments of a deformable multiple-porosity medium. MPET2 offers a comprehensive framework for understanding complex porous media across multiple disciplines. Examples of its applications include studying rock formations, soil mechanics and subsurface reservoirs, investigating biological tissues, modeling groundwater flow and contaminant transport, and optimizing the design of porous materials. Despite the wide range of applications of the model, 
	its numerical discretization has received little attention. Here we propose a stabilized formulation of the MPET2 model. To address the unique challenges posed by the discretization of the MPET model, we use multiple techniques including the Fluid Pressure Laplacian stabilization, Streamline Upwind Petrov–Galerkin stabilization, and discontinuity capturing. Our spatial discretization is based on Isogeometric Analysis with higher-order continuity basis functions. The fully discretized governing equations are solved simultaneously with a monolithic algorithm. We perform a convergence study of the proposed formulation. Then, we conduct a series of simulations of subcutaneous injection of monoclonal antibodies under different injection conditions. Our simulations show that the stabilized MPET2 formulation can provide oscillation-free solutions for tissue deformation, fluid flow in the interstitial tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels, drug absorption in blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, as well as drug transport in each compartment. We also study the effects of different injection conditions on drug absorption, showing the potential of the proposed model and algorithm in the future optimization of injection strategy.},

  abstract = {Subcutaneous injection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has become one of the fastest-growing fields in the pharmaceutical industry. The transport and mechanical processes behind large volume injections are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a large-deformation poroelastic model to study high-dose, high-speed subcutaneous injection. We account for the anisotropy of subcutaneous tissue using of a fibril-reinforced porohyperelastic model. We also incorporate the multi-layer structure of the skin tissue, generating data-driven geometrical models of the tissue layers using histological data. We analyze the impact of handheld autoinjectors on the injection dynamics for different patient forces. Our simulations show the importance of considering the large deformation approach to model large injection volumes. This work opens opportunities to better understand the mechanics and transport processes that occur in large-volume subcutaneous injections of mAbs.}

  abstract = {Subcutaneous injection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has gained increasing interest in the pharmaceutical industry. The transport, distribution and absorption of mAbs in the skin after injection are not yet well-understood. Experiments have shown that fibrous septa form preferential channels for fluid flow in the tissue. The majority of mAbs can only be absorbed through lymphatics which follow closely the septa network. Therefore, studying drug transport in the septa network is vital to the understanding of drug absorption. In this work, we present a mixed-dimensional multi-scale (MDMS) poroelastic model of adipose tissue for subcutaneous injection. More specifically, we model the fibrous septa as reduced-dimensional microscale interfaces embedded in the macroscale tissue matrix. The model is first verified by comparing numerical results against the full-dimensional model where fibrous septa are resolved using fine meshes. Then, we apply the MDMS model to study subcutaneous injection. It is found that the permeability ratio between the septa and matrix, volume capacity of the septa network, and concentration-dependent drug viscosity are important factors affecting the amount of drug entering the septa network which are paths to lymphatics. Our results show that septa play a critical role in the transport of mAbs in the subcutaneous tissue, and this role was previously overlooked.},

  abstract = {Subcutaneous injection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has recently attracted unprecedented interests in the pharmaceutical industry. The drug transport in the tissue and mechanical response of the tissue after injection are not yet well-understood. We are motivated to study subcutaneous injection using poro-elasticity, including linear and nonlinear poro-elastic models. We first present the fixed-stress split of the nonlinear model and perform convergence studies under spatial and temporal refinements. We then investigate the model assumption of the linear model using numerical solutions. In the case of small permeability, the linear model is not adequate to account for the large deformation of the tissue due to injection. Next, we adopt a nonlinear poro-elastic model to study subcutaneous injection. For large deformation, numerical solutions of the nonlinear model differ significantly from that of the linear model, especially near the injection site.}

  abstract = {Subcutaneous injection for self-administration of biotherapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies, has emerged as a fast-growing field in the pharmaceutical industry. Effective drug delivery in the subcutaneous tissue critically depends on the coupled mechanical and transport processes occurring in the tissue during and after the injection. The details of these processes, however, remain poorly understood; and this explains the growing interest in computational approaches. Notably, there are very few computational studies on subcutaneous injection into three-dimensional porous media that account for tissue deformability. Here, we leverage a poroelastic model to analyze the response of subcutaneous tissue under the flow of a pressurized fluid. We propose a computational method based on Isogeometric Analysis that exploits the global continuity of splines. Our model shows the importance of considering tissue deformation and permeability changes in order to obtain more realistic results in terms of fluid pressure and velocity, during and after the injection.}

However, there are very few computational studies of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) that take into account the mechanical contribution of the three layers that comprise the aneurysmal tissue. In this paper, a three-layered finite element model is proposed from the simplest uniaxial stress state to geometrically parametrized models of AAAs with different asymmetry values. Comparisons are made between a three-layered artery wall and a mono-layered intact artery, which represents the complex behavior of the aggregate adventitia-media-intima in a single layer with averaged mechanical properties. Likewise, the response of our idealized geometries is compared with similar experimental and numerical models. Finally, the mechanical contributions of adventitia, media and intima are analyzed for the three-layered aneurysms through the evaluation of the mean stress absorption percentage. Results show the relevance and necessity of considering the inclusion of tunica intima in multi-layered models of AAAs for getting accurate results in terms of peak wall stresses and displacements.}

Uniaxial tensile specimens were extracted and tested at different orientations, and a hypo-elastic–plastic model with Voce hardening and Cockcroft–Latham’s fracture criterion was calibrated against the experimental results.

  abstract = {An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a localized bulge or swelling in the lower part of the aorta, the main blood vessel of the human body that goes from the left ventricle of the heart down through the chest and the tummy, where it splits in two smaller vessels called iliac arteries. They usually remain asymptomatic until rupture, which makes them a life-threatening disease with an overall mortality of more than 80\%. Layer-specific experimental data for human aortic tissue suggest that, in aged arteries and arteries with non-atherosclerotic intimal thickening, the innermost layer of the aorta increases significantly its stiffness and thickness, becoming load-bearing. However, there are 
	very few computational studies of aortic abdominal aneurysms (AAAs) that take into account the mechanical contribution of the three layers that make up the aneurysmal tissue. In this technical project, a three-layered finite element model is proposed from the simplest (uniaxial) stress state, to geometrically parametrized models of AAAs with different asymmetry values. Comparisons are made between a three-layered artery wall, and a mono-layered intact artery, whose constitutive parameters stand for the mean mechanical behavior of the three layers. Likewise, the response of our idealized geometries is compared with similar models. The mechanical contributions of adventitia, media and intima, are also analyzed for the three-layered aneurysms through the evaluation of the mean stress absorption percentage. Results show the relevance of considering the inclusion of tunica intima in multi-layered models of AAAs for getting more accurate results in terms of peak wall stresses and displacements. The last part of this investigation contains a Fluid-Structure Interaction study in parametrized abdominal aortic aneurysms, considering a hyperelastic anisotropic constitutive law for the aneurysmal wall. Because of the high computational cost that it would attain to model a full cardiac cycle in a three-layered aneurysm considering the Fluid-Structure Interaction, only a mono-layered aneurysm is simulated within this final part of the project. As in the previous section, comparisons are made between elastic, hyperelastic isotropic and hyperelastic anisotropic artery walls in terms of stresses and displacements.},
