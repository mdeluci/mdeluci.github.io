#### HYDRAULIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS

Our research is dedicated to advancing the understanding and management of water resources through sophisticated flood analysis and free flow simulations. We employ state-of-the-art computational models to predict and mitigate the impacts of flooding, enhancing the resilience of communities against water-related disasters. Our work also focuses on the dynamics of free surface flows, exploring how water interacts with its surroundings, from riverbeds to urban waterways. This dual approach allows us to develop more effective water management strategies, ensuring sustainable and safe environments. Through our comprehensive studies, we aim to provide actionable insights that lead to improved infrastructure and environmental stewardship.
