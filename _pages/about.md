I am a Research Scientist in the [Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering](https://www.purdue.edu/research/rche/) at Purdue University working with [Prof. Pavlos Vlachos](https://vlachosresearch.org/pub-author/pavlos-p-vlachos/) and [Prof. Hector Gomez](https://engineering.purdue.edu/gomez/hectorgomez). 

I consider myself a computational mechanician, I develop new modeling and computer-based simulation techniques to address real-world problems in mechanical and biomedical engineering. The core of my research philosophy lies in bridging the gap between computational theory and practical application. I am interested in tailoring computational models to capture the complex dynamics occurring at the intersection between biology and mechanics, providing insights that are not easily attainable through experimental methods alone.

In my [PhD thesis](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/Numerical_Simulation_and_Poromechanical_Modeling_of_Subcutaneous_Injection_of_Monoclonal_Antibodies/25674240), I focused on the transport and mechanical processes behind subcutaneous injection for self-administration of biotherapeutics, particularly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). My research developed a high-fidelity computational framework to study large-volume subcutaneous injection of mAbs, combining `large-deformation mechanics`, and `porous media flow` with `drug transport and absorption`. My simulations provided essential insights into improving subcutaneous drug administration and developing patient-centered injection devices and techniques.
