I am a Research Scientist in the [Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering](https://www.purdue.edu/research/rche/) at Purdue University working with [Prof. Pavlos Vlachos](https://vlachosresearch.org/pub-author/pavlos-p-vlachos/) and [Prof. Hector Gomez](https://engineering.purdue.edu/gomez/hectorgomez). 

I developed high-fidelity computational models to solve real-world problems in civil, mechanical, and biomedical engineering. My research interests include computational mechanics, poromechanics, soft tissue biomechanics, and transport phenomena.

In my PhD thesis, I focused on the intricate process of subcutaneous injection for self-administration of biotherapeutics, particularly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The success of this drug delivery process hinges on the coupled mechanical and transport phenomena within the subcutaneous tissue, both during and after injection. My research developed a high-fidelity computational framework to study large-volume subcutaneous injection of mAbs, combining `large-deformation mechanics` with `drug transport and absorption`. By incorporating `data-driven` geometrical models of tissue layers and considering various `medical devices` and human factors, my simulations provided essential insights into improving subcutaneous drug administration and developing patient-centered injection devices and techniques.
