I am a Research Scientist in the [Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering](https://www.purdue.edu/research/rche/) at Purdue University working with [Prof. Pavlos Vlachos](https://vlachosresearch.org/pub-author/pavlos-p-vlachos/) and [Prof. Hector Gomez](https://engineering.purdue.edu/gomez/hectorgomez). 

I developed `high-fidelity numerical models` to solve real-world problems in civil, mechanical, and biomedical engineering. My research interests include computational mechanics, poromechanics, soft tissue biomechanics, and transport phenomena.

In my [PhD thesis](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/Numerical_Simulation_and_Poromechanical_Modeling_of_Subcutaneous_Injection_of_Monoclonal_Antibodies/25674240), I focused on the transport and mechanical processes behind subcutaneous injection for self-administration of biotherapeutics, particularly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). My research developed a high-fidelity computational framework to study large-volume subcutaneous injection of mAbs, combining `large-deformation mechanics` with `drug transport and absorption`. My simulations provided essential insights into improving subcutaneous drug administration and developing patient-centered injection devices and techniques.
