#### Fluid-structure interaction simulation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Coupled fluid-solid approach to modeling pulsatile blood flow in aneurysmal arteries using the Arbitrarian Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) strategy. The solid part is considered as hyperelastic anisotropic by means of the HGO model with two families of collagen fibers helically arranged. Simulations performed during my master's studies at Universidade da Coruna

#### A 'pejino' engineer in the global pharmaceutical elite: Mario de Lucio.
Interview by a local TV from Laredo, Cantabria, Spain, where I talk about my carreer and future endeavors as an engineer in the US. <i>"About to culminate his Ph.D. at Purdue University in the state of Indiana, USA, the young "pejino" Mario de Lucio returns home for a brief parenthesis before adding another milestone to an astonishing trajectory for his age. In this meeting, he reviews projects as emblematic as the bridge that connects Laredo with Santo√±a in the Puntal area. From there, he shares his progress in a delightful interview. Don't miss it."<i> (English captions available)
