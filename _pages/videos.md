#### Fluid-structure interaction simulation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm
Coupled fluid-solid approach to modeling pulsatile blood flow in aneurysmal arteries using the Arbitrarian Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) strategy. The solid part is considered as hyperelastic anisotropic by means of the HGO model with two families of collagen fibers helically arranged. Simulations performed during my master's studies at Universidade da Coruna
