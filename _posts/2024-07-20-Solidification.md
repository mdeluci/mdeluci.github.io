## Phase-field equation for solidification processes
The Cahnâ€“Hilliard equation describes the process of phase separation, by which the two components of a binary fluid spontaneously separate and form domains pure in each component. It was originally proposed in 1958 to model phase separation in binary alloys {% cite Cahn-Hilliard Cahn-Hilliard2 --collection external_references %}. Since then it has been used to describe various phenomena, such as spinodal decomposition {% cite MARALDI201231 --collection external_references %}, diblock copolymer {% cite Choksi --collection external_references %}, image inpainting {% cite 4032803 --collection external_references %}, tumor growth simulation {% cite tumor --collection external_references %} or multiphase fluid flows {% cite BADALASSI2003371 --collection external_references %}.
